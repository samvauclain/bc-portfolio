# bc-portfolio

Tried to make a flex template that I can build on, and use for future projects. Trimmed it down for the portfolio but may end up expanding again. 

## Still to do:
* Animated gif for code image in header, once animated typing of "hello world" is done, have icon and text fade in on the right.
* Some css and javascript fade / slide in on scroll, and other animations. Maybe some parralax?
* Look for some graphic / flat art to incorporate on https://unsplash.com/
* Link logo to go back to top
* Mobile hamburger menu
